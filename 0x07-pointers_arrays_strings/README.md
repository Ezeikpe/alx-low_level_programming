0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

What are pointers to pointers and how to use them

Projects

memset Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n); The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b Returns a pointer to the memory area s

1. memcpy - Write a function that copies memory area. Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n); The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest Returns a pointer to dest

2. strchr - Write a function that locates a character in a string.
Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);

3. strspn - Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
